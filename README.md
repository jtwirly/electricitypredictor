# Electricity Predictor - AI-Powered Ontario Electricity Demand Forecasting

## Project Description
This project aims to develop an AI-powered forecasting model for Ontario electricity demand using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. The model will be able to predict future electricity demand based on historical data and other relevant factors.

## Technologies Used
Python, OpenAI/GPT-3, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Requests, Flask, HTML/CSS

## Setup
